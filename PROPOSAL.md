## My Project Proposal

**What I'm building:** I'm building a random wheel generator.
**Why I chose this:** This will help with making decisions given multiple choices or deciding who in a group of people has to do something. My brothers and I used to always use wheels to make our decisions when we were younger, whether it be for who had to do chores or where we wanted to eat.
**Core features:** 
- take inputs (names or activities)
- randomize inputs
- when prompted, select one of the inputs and print
**What I don't know yet:** 
- I don't know how to randomize the inputs
- I don't know if I should have the selected input removed so the wheel can be used again without that input being selected a second time
