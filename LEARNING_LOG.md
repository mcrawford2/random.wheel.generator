## Session 1: Date: 2026-02-19

**What I asked AI to do:**
- "i'm making a random wheel generator. help with creating an input system for user to add options to the wheel"

**What I didn't understand in the generated code:**
- Using [] to create a list was new to me, although we briefly talked about it in class, I had not yet had practice with it

**What I learned:**
- I learned how to create a list, using the [] as a signifier, append to add the input to the list, and idx/opt(line 44) to print the list with a corresponding number. It was also good practice with the While True loop.





## Session 2:Date: 2026-02-20

**What I asked AI to do:**
- "help with lessening invalid inputs"

**What I didn't understand in the generated code:**
- .strip() and .lower() can be used consecutively in the same line. 

**What I learned:**
- I previously thought that .strip() and .lower() had to be used separately, and did not think they could be used after an input. I also learned how "" can indicate emptiness, such as in an empty and invalid input.





## Session 3: Date: 2026-02-23

**What I asked AI to do:**
- "why is there no output when running the file in the terminal"

**What I didn't understand in the generated code:**
- It helped me generate the code to call the initial catalyst function (line 100), which was not new to me, but I had not realized in all of my previously written code that nothing was being called

**What I learned:**
- No matter how much code you create, none of it will be useful without calling it. This is likely the most important step to remember while writing code, but also a very simple addition in this case. 





## Session 4: Date: 2026-02-25

**What I asked AI to do:**
- "generate prompt to restart at the end"

**What I didn't understand in the generated code:**
- I didn't know I would refer to a function further up in the code, rather than in the following lines

**What I learned:**
- Functions can be called regardless of their location in the code, so long as the necessary variables or other pieces are also logically in place
